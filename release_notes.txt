- Added cycles=25000 to default dosbox.conf to limit CPU usage
- reduced number of drives mounted to dosbox (c,d,y)
- *DosBox auto-sleep* feature! set DOSBOXSLEEP=1 ENV VAR to enable DosBox sleep when VNC client disconnected and resume on VNC connect!
- d:\start.bat in drive_d share can be used to launch DOS apps on container startup
